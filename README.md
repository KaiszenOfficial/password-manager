### Password Manager
![password manager](./screenshots/screenshot.png)

**A simple desktop application to manage all your passwords from a single place.**

#### Tach Stack
*For this project I went with ElectronJS as my choice of framework. ElectronJS is a NodeJS based desktop application building framework.*

#### Current version and future plans
*Currently the app serves the most basic purpose. But there are rooms for improvement which I am planning to get onto such as the the storing mechanism for the saved passwords isn't optimal. I would also like to add a master password feature which will be used to login into the app iteself. The UI at this moment is basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I am planning to build the UI out of some framework, probably ReactJS or Angular (latest).*
